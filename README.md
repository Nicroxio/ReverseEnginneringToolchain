A Reverse Enginnering Toolchain, comprised of tools I have found and heard of. 

# Use 
To use this repo, make a branch from the main line and run the setup script. You will also need to install GDB, Ghidra, Pwntools and patchelf yourself.



# Tools
* GDB
* GEF (https://github.com/hugsy/gef)
* Ghidra 
* pwntools
* pwninit (https://github.com/io12/pwninit) figures out what the bin needs to run
* patchelf (Allows slight modification to binary like making it use a specific linker)
