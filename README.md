# ReverseEnginneringToolchain
Just a place for me to note down things 


* GDB
* GEF (https://github.com/hugsy/gef)
* Ghidra 
* pwntools
* pwninit (https://github.com/io12/pwninit) figures out what the bin needs to run
* patchelf (Allows slight modification to binary like making it use a specific linker)
